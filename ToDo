ToDo

- make annotations clearer
- better description of unique tables vs total

- add citation to annotation db
- make drive folder for shared annotations
-

===============================================
Shiny app / Package
===============================================
Little fixes
- clean up object names to be consistent with bioconductor style (camelCaps)
- "Diversity plot" handling for premature stops (and frame shifts)?
- update comments and documentation in code (mainly VCF_Utils.R)
- Add tair symbols throughout
- clean up tables (shorter column names, round to 3-5 decimals, etc)
- add unique allele counts table on tab1


New Functionalities
- add tab for alignments
- add import custom GFF button on tab1
- hover-over/readme for each tab and table
- ability to get all accessions with a mutation
- Search by tair_symbol
- map accessions from multiple genes at once (checkboxes for genes and variants)
- show diversity on a histogram of genome wide stats

===============================================
DONE!!!
===============================================
- about tab, with bibliography glossary...
- All mentions of ecotype changed to accession
- make download buttons more descriptive about what is being downloaded
- add download button for "gene_info" table
- add radio button for coding/missense/non-coding to "SNP map"
- Highlight all accessions containing the same SNP when selecting in "SNP map" [layer select tool allows isolating one or more SNPs]
- add exclude NA accessions checkbox to "SNP map" [layer select tool, bottom left corner of map]
- make diversity filter slider logrithmic on map tab
- make table in map output a searchable table [done, as well as on plotting tab]
- add a filter to the map page to select specific SNPs after submitting gene, but before generating map.
